1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  1. Event volume, users and sessions
  2. Distribution of clicks and session durations
  3. Engagement differences by version and country

2. Hypothesis Testing
  1. H1: Low engagement sessions lead to churn
  2. H2: Certain app versions have higher bounce rates
  3. H3: Subscription status impacts bounce behavior

3. Segmentation Analysis
  1. Bounce rate by app version
  2. Bounce rate by country
  3. Bounce rate by subscription status and install source
